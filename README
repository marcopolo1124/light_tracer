A simple raytracing algorithm in pygame

Objects in the game can be created using Block class. The Class has attributes:
- Reflectivity: How much a block will reflect the ray
- Absorption coefficient: How qucikly a ray loses power in the medium
- Refraction index: How much the ray bends when entering the medium
- Vertices: The boundaries of the polygon

An environment is created via the Map class. Place the block objects into the map during initialization

When the script runs, the player is the transmitter. The player can move forward and backwards using WASD and rotate the beam of light using UP arrow and DOWN arrow keys
